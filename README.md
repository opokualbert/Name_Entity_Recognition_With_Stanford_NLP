In this short post, I will show how to get the entities in an article or any text documents using Natural language processing technique. We will use the powerful NER Package by Stanford NLP in this tutorial.

Entities could be a person, organization, location, date/time, money, percentage, the list goes on. this is useful if you quickly need to gather the specific salient information about a very long document, example who contacted who at what time and at what place; and which organization do they work for or are they discussing? Was money involved in the dealings and how much? 

If your job involve answering these kinds of questions using text documents, then this tutorial may improve your productivity.
